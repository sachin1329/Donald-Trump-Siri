That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together - now let's go out and make it happen together.",
439,NULL,Hillary,"Now there is a new request. To release transcripts of speeches that were given. When everybody agrees to do that, I will as well. It is important we all abide by the same standards. So let's do the tax return standard first, because that has been the standard for a long time.",

443,NULL,Hillary,"This is what we call smart power. Using every possible tool and partner to advance peace and security. Leaving no one on the sidelines. Showing respect even for one's enemies.

461,NULL,Hillary,"All of us have to recognize that we owe our children more than we have been giving them.",

493,NULL,Hillary,"The American taxpayer should not be treated more shabbily than debtors from other nations and we should be encouraging other nations to help rebuild Iraq's economy.",
494,NULL,Hillary,"We would very much like to see Iran take a position as a responsible leader that doesn't intimidate or threaten or scare its neighbors and others. But the choice is really up to Iran and we're going to keep working to try to come out with the right decision.",

496,NULL,Hillary,"I learned to be far more skeptical of what I'm told by presidents, no matter who the presidents are, and also to be much more cautious, always, in any action or vote that could lead to the use of American military power and most particularly what we call 'boots on the ground.'",
